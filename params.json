  "body": "Pokemon Go is a bona fide cultural phenomenon in the US and elsewhere, with nerds of all ages spending hours tracking down adorable pocket monsters in real/virtual life. As a 90's kid who was there - gameboy in hand - for the original explosion of the Pokemon fad, this resurgence of Pikachu and friends is a particularly sweet combination of throwback nostalgia and innovative augmented reality gameplay. And playing it, as well as talking about it with friends and strangers, has made me curious about how people are discussing the game in my area and beyond. What could be learned about the game or players from these discussions? Armed with a bundle of data from twitter, I looked into it.\r\n\r\n### The sample and goals\r\nI collected 81,165 unique tweets from the US spanning ten days from July 8th (2 days after the release of Pokemon Go in the US) to July 17th. Before really getting into it, I should say that I specifically was interested in how people talk about the various Pokemon themselves. Which Pokemon are especially popular? Do different cities or places like different Pokemon? A secondary theme running through these questions is whether or not popularly discussed Pokemon represent game experiences. In other words, are more commonly discussed Pokemon more frequently found in-game? Do regional differences in discussion reflect different regional Pokemon biodiversity? With all this in mind, I searched for and collected tweets that mentioned any of the original 151 Pokemon and could be associated with some kind of geographic location using Twitter's Places feature. These tweets included 89,624 mentions of 148 Pokemon types - Dewgong and Poliwrath were not mentioned at all, and for ease of processing I lumped both kinds of Nidoran into a single Pokemon type. \r\n\r\n### Pokemon popularity contest\r\n\r\n![Popular Pokemon nationwide graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaWinchester/pokedata/master/figures/pokemon_popular_no_pikachu.png)\r\n\r\nThis graph shows overall nationwide Pokemon popularity in terms of number of tweets for the top 50 Pokemon, excluding Pikachu who tends to act as a bit of a spoiler because of its overwhelming popularity in all cases (see here for a Pikachu-included graph). Clearly the original starters (squirtle, charmander, bulbasaur) and their evolutions (charizard) dominate the list, but also very common are pidgey, rattata, weedle, and magikarp (i.e., the basically-a-normal-animal brigade). Pidgey even has an evolution pretty high up. While I wouldn't necessarily suggest that squirtle is more common in Pokemon Go than charmander or bulbasaur (though maybe it is), it seems likely that the popularity of these otherwise slightly standard Pokemon is due to them being common in Pokemon Go.\r\n\r\n### Breaking things down by city\r\n\r\n![Popular Pokemon by city](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaWinchester/pokedata/master/figures/cities_by_pokemon.png)\r\n\r\nPokemon popularity can be further parsed by city or region to look for geographic differences. This graph shows the 10 most popular Pokemon for the 12 cities/boroughs with the most Pokemon tweets in the dataset. I didn't lump Queens, Manhattan, and Brooklyn into one NYC group because frankly I'm a New Yorker and I'm interested in possible differences between boroughs. This graph excludes Pikachu and the starters (again, if you want to see them included go here) to try and capture differences between Pokemon that are mostly being discussed because they are being encountered in Pokemon Go. I've also excluded Ditto because, being a real english word, it's not exactly reliable data. Anyway, there are undeniable similarities between cities - look at all those eevees, for instance. My suspicion is that this is more due to people being excited about catching an eevee and sharing it on twitter more than them being common. But there do seem to be some differences - check out vulpix (the reddish baby fox) in LA and San Antonio. My personal favorite city oddity is the massive popularity of do-duo (the two-headed emu-type bird) in NYC and Philly, where this Pokemon shows up nowhere on the top 10 lists of any other city. From experience I can testify to a plague of two-headed emu-birds in Brooklyn, and so I'm chalking that one up to regional Pokemon ecosystems. \r\n\r\nWe shouldn't be limited to popularity of Pokemon in absolute numbers, either. What about Pokemon that cities are weirdly into, Pokemon a city is discussing far out of proportion to the rest of the country? The graph below plots the top 10 weirdly popular Pokemon by city, with a weirdness index that communicates how many more times a given city is discussing a Pokemon compared to the rest of the country. As an example, Philly is talking about do-drios about 6 times more than the country overall.\r\n\r\n![Weirdly popular Pokemon by city](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaWinchester/pokedata/master/figures/cities_by_weird_pokemon.png)\r\n\r\n### United States of Pocket Monsters\r\n\r\nIn addition to place names, the tweet dataset also includes place GPS coordinates. This means we can plot these data on a map. This graph shows the number of tweets for locations across the country (and could alternately be called \"Impact sites of the Pokepocalypse\"):\r\n\r\n![Poketweet map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaWinchester/pokedata/master/figures/poketweets.png)\r\n\r\nThis data can be parsed in a number of interesting ways. What about favorite starter Pokemon by state?\r\n\r\n![Popular Pokemon starters by state](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaWinchester/pokedata/master/figures/starters_by_state.png)\r\n\r\nI don't know why Bulbasaur gets such short shrift on the state scale, but there it is. Also check out the Southwest desert states and their love of Charmander.\r\n\r\n![Popular Pokemon by location](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaWinchester/pokedata/master/figures/pokemon_by_locs_50.png)\r\n\r\nThis map shows the most popular Pokemon by US location for locations with more than 50 tweets in the dataset. The map looks a bit more chaotic if you lower the threshold to include locations with more than 25 tweets, but you get a lot more locations included. I'm not completely sure whether there are regional differences visible in the map. There may be some clustering? I'm not sure. But I will point out there is a do-duo over in the NYC area.\r\n\r\n![Weirdly popular Pokemon by location](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaWinchester/pokedata/master/figures/weird_pokemon_by_locs_50.png)\r\n\r\nAnd as a final image, we can also map weirdly popular Pokemon! This uses the same weirdness index as the cities graph above, and includes locations with more than 50 tweets. Here is a second graph with the threshold lowered to 20. \r\n\r\n### Author and repository\r\nJulia Winchester (@JuliaWinchester) collected and crunched the pokedata. The associated repository contains the Python scripts used to gather, parse, and display the data presented here. No Pokemon were harmed in the data analysis. ",
